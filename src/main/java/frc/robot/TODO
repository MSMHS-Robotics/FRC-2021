Todo (1):
 * make it so that this builds
 * spell-check all files
 * flesh out Vision.java
 * make a drive off line auto
 * make the climber subsystem
 * find a way to implement following in RocketSparkMAX_T
 * make checking the name of the joystick using DriverStation.getJoystickName or getJoystickType() to check to make sure the gamepads are in the right mode (d/x)
 * make intakeRaise() and lower() functions actually do stuff
 * add a ticksPerRev_MAX to constants
 * make it so you put distances in inches instead of ticks (add some kind of internal conversion)

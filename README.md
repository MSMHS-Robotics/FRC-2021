# FRC-2021
Code for FRC 2723's 2021 season. Kinda. This was written before the season started as practice and to get a solid foundation going, as last year's code (which this is based on) is a mess. The actual code we would have used for the Skills challenges is in the IR-Skills-2021 repo. This code tries to add simulation support (but not WPILib's because I don't like it) and so might look convoluted. The dev branch has the latest code, and python-doc-gen has a custom script to generate HTML documentation files (like Javadoc) based on the source, because Javadoc wasn't working and I didn't like how Doxygen looked. This repo contains most of my free time during the various school breaks, so it might not be complete, but at least it helped me not be bored.
